# Requirements

- Capture core scanner capabilities (network, cloud, container, IaC).
- Support authenticated and unauthenticated scanning with RBAC.
- Provide machine-readable outputs (JSON/CSV) for automation and CI/CD.
- Expose API-first workflows; UI consumes the same APIs.
- Maintain low-noise, high-signal findings with remediation guidance.
