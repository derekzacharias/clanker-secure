# Traceability

- Backlog: `BACKLOG.md` maps features and phases with labels.
- Principles/Non-goals: `AGENTS.md` captures core principles, capabilities, and heuristics.
- Requirements → Acceptance: `docs/requirements.md` aligns to `docs/acceptance-criteria.md`.
- Implementation artifacts: API schema in `src/clanker/main.py`; UI consumption in `frontend/`.
- Tests: pytest suites under `tests/` mirror core modules and ingest paths.
